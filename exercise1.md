Setting up a functional CI for our python project would require a linting tool suck as flake8 in order to keep a consistent programming style across the development environment. A testing framework such as pytest would assist in streamlining testing.  Integrating both a linter and a testing framework together with our GitHub repository and a CI platform such as Travis CI would allow for easy testing, consistent integration and deployment of our project.  In order to keep consistent and stable versions of python and python libraries, Travis uses pip for python dependencies by default, although custom dependency management is available. Together with separate virtual environments for difference python versions, Travis allows for testing with different dependency versions as well.\
Travis CI includes versions both for cloud-based and self-hosting for continuous integration and deployment. Since our project is being build by only 6 members using travis's cloud-based hosting service would probably be appropriate. Depending on the nature of the project we would be constructing, the cloud-based option could be sufficient for our computational needs. Travis's credit based system allows for our different build needs, providing different VM instances sizes for our project if needed. This would support potentially growing needs of the project. }
